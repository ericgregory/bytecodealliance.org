[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is a fast, secure, and standards-compliant WebAssembly runtime. The latest v26.0 release includes enhancements such as implementation of the "table64" extension, a new `wasmtime completion` subcommand, ARM64 Windows support, and more. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

* The [memory64 proposal to WebAssembly was recently updated](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64/issues/51) to include 64-bit tables in addition to 64-bit memories. With this release, Wasmtime supports the extension. 
* It's now possible to compile Wasm modules via the Pulley interpreter with `wasmtime compile`.
* The `wasmtime completion` subcommand can be used to generate shell completions for the installed version of Wasmtime. 
* Wasmtime now fully supports ARM64 Windows with a release binary available.

## What's new in Wasmtime v26.0

Wasmtime v26.0 includes a variety of enhancements and fixes. The release notes are available [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v26.0.0).

### Added

* The "table64" extension of the memory64 proposals to WebAssembly has been implemented. [#9206](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9206)
* Initial support has been added for compiling WebAssembly modules with Pulley, Wasmtime's interpreter. Note that the interpreter is not feature complete yet. [#9240](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9240)
* Wasmtime can now execute code without relying on host-based signal handlers. [#9230](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9230)
* Work has continued on implementing the GC proposals in Wasmtime. [#9246](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9246) [#9244](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9244) [#9271](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9271) [#9275](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9275) [#9278](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9278) [#9282](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9282) [#9285](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9285) [#9326](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9326) [#9341](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9341) [#9358](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9358)
* Support for ARM64 Windows has been finished with support for unwinding. Release binaries are now also available for this platform. [#9266](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9266) [#9283](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9283)
* The `bindgen!` macro now supports multiple paths to load WIT from. [#9288](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9288)
* A new `-W async-stack-size=N` argument has been added to the CLI. [#9302](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9302)
* A new `wasmtime completion` subcommand can be used to generate a completion script for the Wasmtime CLI. [#9312](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9312)
* Components now support `initialize_copy_on_write_image` like core modules. [#9357](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9357)
* Initial support for the ISLE verifier Crocus has landed. [#9178](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9178)

### Changed

* Wasmtime now requires Rust 1.79.0 to compile. [#9202](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9202)
* The `future-trailers.get` in `wasi-http` now returns `none` when trailers are absent. [#9208](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9208)
* The Cranelift instructions `iadd_cin` and `isub_bin` were removed. The`isub_borrow` and `iadd_carry` instructions were renamed to `{u,s}add_carry` and `{u,s}sub_borrow`. [#9199](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9199)
* Winch now supports multi-value results on AArch64. [#9218](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9218)
* Some issues related to `shutdown` have been fixed with WASI sockets. [#9225](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9225)
* Cranelift now has a Cargo feature to enable support for all native ISAs and not Pulley. [#9237](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9237)
* Cranelift support for `StructArgument` in the arm64, riscv64, and s390x backends has been removed. [#9258](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9258)
* The pooling allocator no longer limits instances/memories/tables by default. [#9257](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9257)
* Stack overflow on an async stack will now print a message that this happened. [#9304](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9304)
* Cranelift's `cranelift-wasm` crate has been removed and folded directly into `wasmtime-cranelift`. [#9313](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9313)
* Cranelift's `TrapCode` type is now represented with a single byte. [#9338](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9338)

### Fixed

* Stack slots in Cranelift are now aligned from the start instead of the end. [#9279](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9279)
* The WASIp1 adapter now correctly handles allocations where the initial alignment consumes the entire allocation. [#9356](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9356)
