This month's v27.0 release of [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)&mdash;the fast, secure, and standards-compliant WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime&mdash;includes enhancements such as completed support for the new Wasm garbage collection proposal, a PyTorch backend for `wasi-nn`, link-time feature gate configuration for unstable WIT APIs, and more. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

* Wasmtime now fully supports the [WebAssembly Garbage Collection (GC) proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc). In addition to the GC, Wasmtime now includes a "null" collector that bump-allocates until the heap is exhausted.
* A PyTorch backend [has been added](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9234) for `wasi-nn`, gated behind a `wasi-nn` feature flag: `--features pytorch`
* Wasmtime's in-repo documentation has been updated to track [the implementation of various Wasm proposals in Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/stability-wasm-proposals.md). 

## What's new in Wasmtime v27.0

There are a variety of enhancements and fixes in Wasmtime 27.0. You can find the release notes [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v27.0.0).
